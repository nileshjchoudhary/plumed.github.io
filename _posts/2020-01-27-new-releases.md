It is a pleasure to announce three new PLUMED releases!

Release 2.6.0 is a brand new release that contains many new features, see [here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.6/user-doc/html/_c_h_a_n_g_e_s-2-6.html). It also contains some additional user-contributed modules.

Release 2.5.4 is a maintenance release on the 2.4.x branch and solves a few bugs, see [here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.5/user-doc/html/_c_h_a_n_g_e_s-2-5.html).

Release 2.4.7 is the last maintenance release on branch 2.4.x, see [here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.4/user-doc/html/_c_h_a_n_g_e_s-2-4.html). This branch won't be maintained anymore.

We will still fix bugs in branch 2.5.x for a while, but users are encouraged to upgrade to the new 2.6.x release. Just read carefully the change log before upgrading, paying attention to the changes that lead to incompatible behavior.

You can find all releases in the [download](/download.html) section of the plumed webpage. They are also tagged on [GitHub](https://github.com/plumed/plumed2) (v2.6.0, v2.5.4, and v2.4.7).
