It is a pleasure to announce three new PLUMED releases!

Release 2.6.1 is a maintenance release on the 2.6.x branch and includes updated GROMACS patches.

Release 2.5.5 is a maintenance release on the 2.5.x branch.

Release 2.4.8 is a maintenance release on the 2.4.x branch.

They all solve minor bugs (see [changes for 2.4.8 here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.6/user-doc/html/_c_h_a_n_g_e_s-2-4.html)).

You can find all releases in the download section of the plumed webpage. They are also tagged on github.
