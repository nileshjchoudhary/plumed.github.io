---

PLUMED Masterclass is a series of virtual and interactive classes, each one focused on a specific 
theme ranging from basic concepts to advanced topics in molecular simulations.

Each class is composed by two lectures held on Zoom:

* Lecture I: an overview of the methodological background followed by a brief description of the exercises assigned to the students;
* Lecture II: a practical lecture in which the instructor solves the assigned exercises.

In between the two lectures, the participants will have one week to complete the exercises on their own or in groups.
The first series of lectures will start in January 2021 and will be delivered by the PLUMED developers.
The classes will be focused on: PLUMED syntax and analysis, statistical errors in MD, umbrella sampling, metadynamics, 
replica exchange methods, dimensionality reduction, and performance optimization.
