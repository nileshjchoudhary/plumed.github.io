PLUMED Masterclass
------------------

PLUMED Masterclass is a series of virtual and interactive lectures, each one
focused on a specific theme ranging from basic concepts to advanced topics in molecular simulations.
Each class is composed by two lessons: 
* Lesson I: an overview of the methodological background followed by a brief description of the exercises assigned to the students;
* Lesson II: a practical lecture in which the instructor solves the assigned exercises.
In between the two lessons the participants will have one week to complete the exercises on their own or in groups.
